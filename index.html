<h1> My favorite hobby </h1>
<h2> Drawing/Painting </h2
<section>
 
<p id="Paragraph"> My favorite hobby is drawing because it gives me the freedom to just make whatever! In one drawing I could be a witch and in another a dragon! The possibilites aer endless. It also helps me exprese my mood. If the drawing is bad and full of scribbles im ot that happy if its colorfull and neat im  in a good mood. It is my favoriite thing in the world and I am always ready when some inspiration hits me! My drawings can be scary at times or super cute! I love to take a ready made drawing and try and copy but with my own touches! </p>

<h1 id="p2"> Harry Potter </h1>
<p id="p3"> I love Harry Potter its one of my favorite books to read and I wish I had found out about its sooner because my society library has all the book and because of COVID-19 I cant go there anymore. But Still I love the series there are so many jokes and serious moments. Its baisically a coming of age story for our main character Harry Potter there are seven books,eight movies and 1 play. </p>

Luna is ecentric she was told of creature called crumple horned snorkaks or Nargles etc. Even in the wizarding world those creatures were not real. Luna was an active member of the D.A and helped with the battle of the department of mysterys and the battle of Hogwarts.
